# CS-230-Project

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room wanted a program designed for a game called Draw it or Lose it. This game was a web application that would allow multiple people to play together.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
The thing I did best in this project was createing the UML diagram.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through the design document helped me understand how the game worked better.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise my recomendation portion so that it was more specific on how I thought the app should be built. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The Gaming room wanted the game to work on Windows Linux and Mac so I recommended that they build there game as a web application making it easier to have work on all systems.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I broke the task down into smaller steps so ite was eaiser to tackle the whole project.
